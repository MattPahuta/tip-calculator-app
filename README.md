## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
- See error states when required data is missing

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

The design calls for the error states to be inline with the input labels (Bill, Number of People), but on smaller screens there just isn't enough space to accomplish this without overlapping the content. There's no design comp for the errors on mobile, but this seemed like the most reasonable approach to me.

In general, I didn't spend a terrible amount of time trying to make a pixel perfect match with this project. As a non-pro Figma user, this design file felt a little more frustrating than usual. Instead, I eyeballed much of the final design and sought to achieve something that looked decent enough on various screens.

I'm still somewhat baffled by how to achieve a truly accessible form with radio inputs styled in this way. I'm hoping it's not too woefully inadequate in that department but if anyone has any particular skills and experience here I'd welcome the feedback.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

The error elements (p elements) are currently part of the initial DOM and empty by default. Empty elements like this are generally a bad practice. A future enhancement of this project would include dynamically creating/removing the error elements as needed.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
